### Course Description
This course explores experimental applications of web graphics technology in the service of communicating spatial narratives. The spatial narratives will strive to reimagine the concept of space and the practice of storytelling in the context of browser-based graphics environments. This course will contemplate specifically the use of 3-dimensional media via the web as a vehicle for delivering spatial narratives. Web graphics technologies, such as CSS, SVG, Canvas and WebGL, have dramatically increased in their compatibility with both mobile and desktop computing devices and have consequently broadened the reach of graphically rich content to the masses. Students will work on a semester-long project in the form of an interactive web application that challenges, augments, or reaffirms the sense of space through deliberate use of storytelling devices. Upon culmination, the projects will be exhibited on the course website for public viewing. The first half of the course will consist of workshops for building various skills from asset creation to graphics programming. Starting with a brief introduction to HTML/CSS/JS and the Jekyll site generator, the workshops will focus primarily on the THREE.js library. The second half of the course will focus on the production of the final project where class times will turn into hack sessions. While there is no prerequisite for this course, some familiarity of the technologies mentioned above and basic programming skills are highly preferred. First class will meet after Labor Day on September 6, 2017.
